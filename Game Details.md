## Game Details:
Our game combines the classic Mario-style platforming framework, the high difficulty and punishment mechanics of Souls-like games, and an open-world level design, creating a unique gameplay experience unlike any before.

Unlike traditional platformers, our game introduces several key innovations:

_1. Death Punishment System Inspired by Souls-like Games_
   - Players can respawn infinitely, just like in Souls-like games.
   - Dying does not end the game, but each time a player dies, their collected coins are halved, forcing them to play more cautiously instead of feel free retrying.
   - This adds strategy, making players decide when to take risks and when to play it safe, unlike traditional platformers with limited lives.
     
_2.Open-World Level Design_
  - Unlike classic platformers that follow a linear progression, our game allows for free exploration and teleportation between levels.
  - They can go back to earlier levels, find important items, or level up, making the game more interactive instead of just moving forward.
    
_3. Extreme Challenge_
   Our game is designed to test players' patience and reaction speed, with traps that keep them on their toes:
  - Hidden Spikes : Only appear when players get close, leading to instant death and forcing them to memorize the map.
  - Chasing Spikes: Once triggered, deadly spikes rush toward the player, requiring quick reflexes to escape.
  - Moving Traps & Platforms: Some platforms move unexpectedly when players step on them, turning into hidden traps.

_4. Progression System_
    Experience & Upgrades: 
  - Players collect cans to level up and unlock new abilities, such as increasing character size or double jumping, whereas traditional games which growth is mainly based on power-ups.
