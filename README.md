|Mario's Soul|Souls-like Gameplay in Super Mario Souls-like games (like Dark Souls) and sports games (like the FIFA series) are my favorite types of games, and I hope to incorporate elements of them into my course project, even though it might be highly challenging. My smart and cute teammates have discussed many mini-games, like Box Push and Plane Shooting, which are both classic and fun. My idea is to add some mechanics from Souls-like games on top of these mini-games to make the game more challenging. For example, integrating Souls-like mechanics into Super Mario, such as reducing checkpoints or setting death penalties, to increase the difficulty. The challenge of this design lies in the large content of the Super Mario game itself and how to implement the Souls-like mechanics.|
