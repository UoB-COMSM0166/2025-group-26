## Project Report

### Introduction

- 5% ~250 words 
- Describe your game, what is based on, what makes it novel? 

Our game, Dukat Soul, is a mini-game that merges the iconic platforming elements of Super Mario with the punishing mechanics of "Soulslike" games. Built on the familiar foundation of side-scrolling action, the game reimagines Mario‚Äôs cheerful, forgiving world into a challenging adventure that tests both patience and precision.

Inspired by the legendary Dark Souls series, Dukat Soul introduces a significantly higher difficulty curve, where players are expected to learn through repeated failure. Each level is designed with meticulous traps and unpredictable enemy patterns, forcing players to carefully study and adapt to progress. Unlike traditional Mario games, death carries a heavier penalty: lose them permanently.

What makes the game novel is its fusion of two seemingly opposite genres: the lighthearted, accessible gameplay of Super Mario with the grim, hardcore philosophy of Soulslike design. This contrast creates a fresh gameplay experience where nostalgic platforming meets strategic, high-stakes survival. By transforming a familiar icon into a vessel for unforgiving challenge, Dukat Soul offers both fans of classic Mario and Souls veterans a unique twist on two beloved gaming traditions.

## 1.	Collaboration and Communication<br>
In this game development project, we adopted an agile development approach to ensure steady progress and high quality. We used a hybrid communication model, with in-person meetings as the main method and online meetings as a supplement, to maintain effective teamwork.<br>

Specifically, we used our Tuesday class time each week to complete team tasks, and held face-to-face team meetings every Saturday from 10 AM to 12 PM. These meetings included progress updates, to-do reviews, workload evaluation, and planning for the next sprint. We also valued user experience, so we conducted two rounds of user testing‚Äîone in the middle of the project and one near the end‚Äîusing the feedback to continuously improve gameplay.<br>

For urgent or unclear issues, we used Microsoft Teams to hold quick online meetings. This helped us resolve misunderstandings in real time and prevented delays in team progress.<br>

For weekly meeting notes and task planning, we used Notion to keep records. The platform not only offers great flexibility for customizing layouts and content, but also allows all team members to access a shared workspace. This made it easy for us to track progress and reflect on our work. For daily communication, we used WeChat to share ideas, provide updates and feedback, and ask for help when needed. This allowed us to maintain smooth and efficient communication throughout the project.<br>

Overall, our structured yet flexible communication approach played a key role in keeping the team aligned, solving problems quickly, and delivering the project successfully on time.<br>
