## 2nd Story
As a game designer, I am also a loyal user of electronic games, and my favorite game genre is soul games. I hope to let more people experience the charm of soul games. However, due to the high threshold of soul games and the fact that a considerable number of people do not like the dark style of soul games, I have decided to design a lightweight soul game - Mario Souls. This game transplants some of the mechanisms of soul games into a Mario based setting, presenting the game content in a flat 2D format, making it easier for people to get started, more willing to accept this art style, and most importantly, allowing people to experience the mechanisms of soul games.
