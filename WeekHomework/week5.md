    Designing a game with simple controls is easy, but what's more important is how engaging it is and how much players enjoy it. In this round, weâ€™re focusing on the challenges of designing a game that truly captivates players, rather than just being easy to operate.\

## 2nd Story
### As a game designer, I am also a loyal user of electronic games, and my favorite game genre is soul games. I hope to let more people experience the charm of soul games. However, due to the high threshold of soul games and the fact that a considerable number of people do not like the dark style of soul games, I have decided to design a lightweight soul game - Mario Souls. This game transplants some of the mechanisms of soul games into a Mario based setting, presenting the game content in a flat 2D format, making it easier for people to get started, more willing to accept this art style, and most importantly, allowing people to experience the mechanisms of soul games.
